# LoopRNA

LoopRNA is a Java module designed to add convenience and simplicity to the process of automatic RNA secondary structure annotation. By using concepts from Object-Oriented Programming and Mathematical Graph Theory, LoopRNA is able to present RNA secondary structure as a tree of discrete self-contained objects, arranged in a non-linear hierarchical “tree” structure. This produces data which is both easily human-readable and very simple to run otherwise complex automated computations on. While LoopRNA is not a standalone programme, integrating it into pre-existing Java software is trivial thanks to a simple and straight-forward interface. Combined with existing pre-miRNA prediction software, LoopRNA can be applicable both to miRNA hairpin annotation and curation and to de novo prediction of miRNAs.
